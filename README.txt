Search Algorithms with GUI

Project Overview: Developed a comprehensive application to demonstrate various search algorithms, including Linear Search, Binary Search, Binary Search Tree (BST), and Red-Black Tree. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter to provide an interactive way to visualize and understand these algorithms.
Key Features:

    Linear Search: Implemented a straightforward search algorithm to find elements in a list sequentially.
    Binary Search: Developed an efficient algorithm to search for elements in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
    Binary Search Tree (BST): Created a data structure that facilitates fast lookup, addition, and deletion of items using tree nodes.
    Red-Black Tree: Implemented a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced, providing efficient search times.
